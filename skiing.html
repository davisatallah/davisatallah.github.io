<p>For as long as i can remember I have been skiing. I have memories of my dad taking me up to the top of the mountain when i was little, expecting me to be able to ski, only to see me take off my skiis and slide head first down the hill. Every since I first stepped into a ski boot I loved how I could just fly down the mountain practically free. I think skiing will stay with me the rest of my life and continoue to be one of my favorite activities to do.</p>
